### 1. r/webdev Post

**Title:** Built a privacy-first file converter that runs entirely in your browser (WebAssembly)

**Body:**
Hey r/webdev! I've been working on FormatFuse, a file conversion platform that processes everything locally using WebAssembly. No uploads, no servers - just pure client-side processing.

**What makes it different:**
- 100% client-side processing using WASM
- Support for 30+ file formats (images, PDFs, documents)
- Zero data leaves your browser
- No file size limits (except your RAM)
- Works offline after first load

**Tech stack:**
- Astro + React for the frontend
- WebAssembly for all conversions
- Web Workers to keep UI responsive
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling

**Looking for feedback on:**
- Performance with large files
- Which converters you'd use most
- UI/UX improvements
- Missing features

Would love to hear your thoughts! What file conversions do you find yourself needing most often?
Or Any tools that you would like to be added to the platform as a browser only tool.

### 2. r/privacy Post

**Title:** I built a file converter that never touches a server - everything runs in your browser

**Body:**
Privacy advocates of Reddit! Tired of uploading sensitive documents to random conversion sites? I built FormatFuse to solve this problem.

**Privacy features:**
- ✅ No file uploads - everything processes locally
- ✅ No tracking or analytics
- ✅ No account required
- ✅ Works offline after first visit
- ✅ Open issue tracker for transparency

**Supported conversions:**
- Images: HEIC→JPG, PNG→JPG, WebP conversion, and more
- PDFs: Split, merge, rotate (compress coming soon)
- Documents: Markdown→HTML, Text→PDF
- Developer tools: Base64 encoding, JSON formatting

The entire conversion happens in your browser using WebAssembly. Your files never leave your device.

### 3. r/SideProject Post

**Title:** [ShowHN] FormatFuse - My attempt at building a browser-only tool collection

**Body:**
I've been building FormatFuse for the past 6 months after getting frustrated with existing file converters that are slow, full of ads, or have tiny file limits. Slowly I have also added more tools that I use. The goal now is to build better UX. But I realised I need feedback from other people to go and use this and help with the direction that this tool is taking.

**The journey so far:**
- Started with just image conversions
- Now supports 30+ formats
- Everything runs on the browser itself.
- Built with Astro, React, and WebAssembly

**Current stats:**
- 15+ converters live
- Processing happens in seconds
- No file size limits

**Challenges faced:**
- Getting WASM to work efficiently
- Making it mobile-friendly
- Balancing features vs performance

**What's next:**
- Browser extension
- Maybe an API for developers

Would love feedback from fellow builders! What features would make you actually use this over alternatives?

Or any new tool ideas that you always wanted.
