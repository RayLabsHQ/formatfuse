  {
    question: 'What is an LZMA file?',
    answer: 'LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain Algorithm) is a lossless compression algorithm known for high compression ratios and relatively fast decompression. It\'s the predecessor to LZMA2 used in XZ format.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How is LZMA different from XZ?',
    answer: 'LZMA is the original format using the LZMA algorithm, while XZ is a newer container format that typically uses LZMA2 (an improved version). XZ provides better streaming support and integrity checking.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What software creates LZMA files?',
    answer: 'LZMA files can be created by 7-Zip, XZ Utils, and various other compression tools. The format is often used in embedded systems and software installers due to its excellent compression ratio.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why use LZMA compression?',
    answer: 'LZMA offers one of the best compression ratios available, making it ideal for software distribution, firmware updates, and situations where minimizing file size is critical, even if compression takes longer.'
  }
