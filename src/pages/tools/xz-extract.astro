  {
    question: 'What is an XZ file?',
    answer: 'XZ is a lossless compression format that uses the LZMA2 compression algorithm. It provides high compression ratios, often better than gzip or bzip2, making it popular for distributing source code and software packages.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does XZ compare to other compression formats?',
    answer: 'XZ typically achieves 30% better compression than gzip and 15% better than bzip2, but with slower compression speed. It\'s ideal when file size is more important than compression time.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a .txz file?',
    answer: 'A .txz file is a TAR archive compressed with XZ. It combines the archiving capabilities of TAR with XZ compression. Our tool can extract these files to give you access to the contained files.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Where are XZ files commonly used?',
    answer: 'XZ compression is widely used in Linux distributions for package management, source code distribution, kernel archives, and software releases where maximum compression is desired.'
  }
