  {
    question: 'What is a GZ file?',
    answer: 'GZ files use GZIP compression, a popular format on Unix and Linux systems. GZIP provides good compression with fast decompression, making it ideal for web content, log files, and software distribution.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between .gz and .tgz?',
    answer: 'A .gz file is typically a single compressed file, while .tgz (or .tar.gz) is a TAR archive that has been compressed with GZIP. TGZ files can contain multiple files and directories.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I extract .tar.gz files?',
    answer: 'Yes! Our extractor handles both .gz files (single compressed files) and .tgz/.tar.gz files (compressed TAR archives containing multiple files).'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why are GZ files so common?',
    answer: 'GZIP is widely used because it provides a good balance of compression ratio and speed. It\'s the standard for web compression (used by browsers), log file compression, and is built into most Unix/Linux systems.'
