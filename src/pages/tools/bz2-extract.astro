  {
    question: 'What is a BZ2 file?',
    answer: 'BZ2 files use BZIP2 compression, which provides better compression than GZIP but with slower compression speed. It uses the Burrows-Wheeler transform and Huffman coding to achieve high compression ratios.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does BZIP2 compare to other formats?',
    answer: 'BZIP2 typically compresses 20-30% better than GZIP but is slower. It\'s faster than XZ/LZMA but doesn\'t compress as well. It\'s a good middle ground when you need better compression than GZIP.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a .tbz2 file?',
    answer: 'A .tbz2 (or .tar.bz2) file is a TAR archive compressed with BZIP2. It combines TAR\'s ability to bundle multiple files with BZIP2\'s compression. Our tool can extract these to access all contained files.'
  },
  {
    question: 'When should I use BZIP2?',
    answer: 'BZIP2 is ideal for archiving data where compression ratio is important but you also need reasonable decompression speed. It\'s commonly used for source code archives, backups, and large text files.'
  }
