    question: "How much can PDF compression reduce file size?",
    answer: "Compression typically reduces file size by 20-80% depending on the content. PDFs with many images see the most reduction, while text-only PDFs compress less. Our smart compression maintains readability while achieving optimal size reduction."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between compression quality levels?",
    answer: "High quality preserves almost all detail (10-30% reduction), Medium balances quality and size (30-60% reduction), and Low maximizes compression (50-80% reduction). Custom mode lets you fine-tune the exact balance you need."
  },
  {
    question: "Will compression affect text quality?",
    answer: "Text remains sharp and searchable at all compression levels. Only embedded images are compressed. If you enable grayscale conversion, color images become black and white but text quality is preserved."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I batch compress multiple PDFs?",
    answer: "Yes! You can select multiple PDFs and compress them all with the same settings. Each file is processed individually and can be downloaded separately or all together as a ZIP file."
  }
